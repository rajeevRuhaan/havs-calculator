## HAVS ( hand-arm vibration syndrome) Calculator 

Made this calculator as assignment task

#### Many people are exposed to vibration as part of their jobs, using vibrating equipment such as breakers, wacker plates, hammer drills and even lawnmowers. In the short term, you might not notice any problems with this. But regular exposure can have a devastating impact over time, as nerves, muscles and joints become damaged. Numbness, loss of strength and grip are all symptoms of hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) caused by vibration. And once developed, it's effects are irreversible.

### What is the Exposure Limit Value (ELV)?
- The Control of Vibration at Work Regulations are in place to prevent workers from developing ill-health due to exposure to vibration at work. To avoid the symptoms of HAVS, it limits the amount of vibration a user can be exposed to at work.

The regulations set an exposure limit value (ELV) of 5m/s²A(8), which you must not exceed.

Let's break that down so we can understand what number and letters mean.

5 = the limit value.

m/s² = metres per second squared. This is a measure of the intensity of vibration exposure, meaning the level of vibration.

A(8) = average over 8 hours. This is a measure of the duration of vibration exposure, meaning how long you are exposed for.

But how do you calculate vibration exposure at work to know if you are exceeding the limit value?

## Calculating the Exposure Limit Value (ELV)
In this example, we use 400 points to represent our ELV of 5m/s²A(8). All you need to remember is, your maximum exposure is 400 points. Once you have used 400 points in a day, you have reached the limit.

Now we have our maximum points, we need to give each tool a points per hour rating. This rating is how many points you use up for each hour on the tool. The maths that we have to use to give our tool the correct amount of points is its vibration output squared and then doubled. It's more simple written like this...

(Output x Output) x 2 = Points

Ok, let's look at our 10m/s² tool. We multiply the vibration value by itself (10 x 10) and then double it.

(10 x 10) x 2 = 200

So that gives us 200 points per hour when using our 10m/s² tool.

We know we only have 400 points per day, so if we divide our 400 points by the points per hour, this tells us the maximum time we can use the tool for.

400 / 200 = 2

2 hours. Once this time is up, you have used up all your vibration points for the day, and you can't be exposed to any more vibration, from this or any other tool.
